What is this?
Hey there! This is a simple project I put together to show my grasp of HTML5 multimedia elements. While a lot of people jump straight into fancy frameworks, I wanted to go back to the basics and demonstrate that I know how to handle the core building blocks of the web: images, audio, and video.

Why I built this
I wanted a clean, organized way to prove that I understand:

Semantic Structure: Not just using <div> for everything, but using tags that actually mean something (like <figure> and <section>).

Accessibility: Making sure images have descriptions and media has fallbacks so everyone can use the site.

File Management: Keeping a clean project folder so other developers can actually read my code.

What's inside?
Images: I used the <figure> and <figcaption> tags to give the photos proper context.

Audio: A built-in player for MP3s—no external plugins needed.

Video: A self-hosted video player with a "poster" image (that's the thumbnail you see before you hit play).
